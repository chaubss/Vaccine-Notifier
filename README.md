# Vaccine-Notifier
A Python Script that notifies a user when a new vaccination slot has opened up in their district. It uses the [Twilio SMS API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api) to notify the user when it has found a slot.

It also contains the code to book an available slot automatically in case it is found to be available.
